too expensive
costs too much
can't afford it
i don't have the money
out of budget
no money for that
i'm broke
it’s not in my budget
[response]
Totally get that — most people assume solar is a huge expense because they’re thinking about owning panels. What we're talking about here is actually a **relief program** — it's a no-cost setup where you just agree to buy power at a lower rate. You're not taking on a big loan, and there's no upfront investment. The goal is to **reduce what you're already paying**, not add to it. 
So out of curiosity — what's your average summer bill look like?
[followup]
Oh wow, yeah — that’s exactly the kind of usage this was built for. Let’s see what we can save you.

[objection]
solar is a scam
heard bad things about solar
my friend got scammed
it doesn't work
two bills now
it’s a ripoff
my buddy had a terrible experience
they lied to me
got burned by solar before
[response]
You’re right to be skeptical — there are a lot of companies doing it the wrong way. What we’re part of is a **state-backed relief program** that only works if it actually saves you money. There's no sales pitch or pressure — just a technician who explains what it would look like, and if it doesn’t save you money, you walk away.  
Fair enough?
[followup]
Totally — no pressure either way, but good to at least see if you qualify, right?

[objection]
money upfront
i don't want to pay anything today
down payment required?
how much up front?
do i need to pay to get started?
[response]
Totally fair — if there was a big cost upfront, I’d feel the same way. This program is **$0 down** — no install fees, no setup costs. You’re simply switching power providers and locking in a better rate.  
You’re still getting a full system, it’s just funded differently.  
Do you own the home?
[followup]
Perfect — that’s exactly the kind of property this applies to.

[objection]
i hate how it looks
they're ugly
my HOA won’t allow it
i don’t want panels on my roof
it's gonna ruin my curb appeal
solar panels look bad
[response]
Yeah I get that — aesthetics matter. A lot of newer installs are actually **black-on-black low-profile panels** that blend in way better. Some even go on the back side of the roof if you prefer. But let’s be real — if it cut your bill by 30–40%, would the look still be a dealbreaker?
[followup]
Exactly — and honestly, most people say they barely even notice them after install.

[objection]
why do you need my credit?
why do you need to check my credit?
do i have to give you my social?
what does credit have to do with this?
i'm not giving out my info
[response]
Good question. This is a **relief program**, and to qualify they just want to make sure you're a responsible homeowner — so they ask if your score is at least **650 or better**. No social, no pull, nothing sensitive — it's just a qualification filter.  
Would you say you’re above that?
[followup]
Awesome — that should definitely qualify you for the better rate tiers.

[objection]
i’m in oil and gas
i work in energy
i don’t support solar
i don’t believe in solar
i'm pro fossil fuel
[response]
Hey, that’s fair — and to be honest, most of the people going solar aren't doing it to be green. They're doing it to **beat the utility hikes**. It’s not political — it’s just smart long-term math.  
What do your summer bills usually look like out there?
[followup]
Whew yeah, you’re definitely overpaying. Let’s change that.

[objection]
technology isn't there yet
solar tech isn't reliable
it breaks all the time
i don't trust the tech
[response]
Totally hear you — but just so you know, the **tech hasn't really changed much in the last 10 years**. These systems are already warrantied for 25 years and produce reliably year after year. This isn’t beta tech — it's proven and built to last.  
Is your roof in good shape right now?
[followup]
Perfect — that’s all we’d really need to check to get you qualified.

[objection]
i don’t want to finance
i don’t want a loan
i don’t like debt
i’m not taking on a payment
no new bills
[response]
Totally makes sense — and that’s actually why this isn’t a traditional loan or finance deal. You’re not buying panels — you’re just switching where you buy power from and locking in a cheaper rate.  
No new loan, no debt added — just savings.  
What kind of bill range do you usually see?
[followup]
Wow — okay yeah, that’s a good chunk of change you’re already spending.

[objection]
i’m not staying here long
not my forever home
i might sell soon
i’m moving eventually
[response]
Totally get that — and honestly, solar actually **makes homes sell faster and for more**. The new buyer just inherits the lower bill, so you don’t lose a penny. It’s not like a remodel — it’s just passing along savings.  
How long are you planning to stay?
[followup]
Nice — that gives us plenty of time to show the benefit and get you some savings.

[objection]
what is this?
what's the point of this call?
what's this about?
why are you calling?
[response]
Great question — it’s actually super simple. We’re just setting up a quick **consultation with a technician** to check if your home qualifies for this relief program. Takes 10–15 minutes and just shows how much you’d save.  
What’s your schedule like this week?
[followup]
Cool — I’ll make sure they reach out to confirm what works best for you.

[objection]
how does it work?
explain the program
what do i need to do?
what happens next?
[response]
Love the curiosity — here’s the gist: a technician comes by, checks if your home qualifies, shows you the savings estimate, and answers all your questions. If it makes sense, great. If not, no pressure.  
Do you usually have high summer bills?
[followup]
Oof yeah — we’ve been seeing that a lot lately. Glad we caught you now.

[objection]
i’m out of town
i’m traveling
i'm not home right now
i’m out of state
[response]
No worries — we’re just scheduling the **next available window**. I’ll note that you’re out of town now, but we’ll get you set for when you’re back.  
What day are you flying back in?
[followup]
Perfect — we’ll set it up right after you’re back.

[objection]
i can’t this week
too busy this week
swamped right now
got too much going on
maybe next week
[response]
Totally understandable — we’re booking out next week too. Let me see what’s still open… are you better earlier in the week or later?
[followup]
Alright — I’ll pencil you in for that part of the week.

[objection]
i can’t today
not available today
today doesn't work
try me later
[response]
All good — we’ve got availability later this week and into next. Are mornings or evenings easier for you?
[followup]
Got it — we’ll lean toward that time when setting you up.

[objection]
i can’t tonight
not tonight
tonight’s not good
[response]
No problem — we’ve got slots tomorrow and the rest of the week too. Are you more of a morning or afternoon type?
[followup]
Sounds good — I’ll mark you down for that slot.

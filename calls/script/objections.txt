too expensive
[response]
Totally get that — most people assume solar is a huge expense because they’re thinking about owning panels. What we're talking about here is actually a **relief program** — it's a no-cost setup where you just agree to buy power at a lower rate. You're not taking on a big loan, and there's no upfront investment. The goal is to **reduce what you're already paying**, not add to it. 
So out of curiosity — what's your average summer bill look like?
[followup]
Oh wow, yeah — that’s exactly the kind of usage this was built for. Let’s see what we can save you.

[objection]
costs too much
[response]
Makes sense — that’s what most people think at first. But the thing is, this isn’t about buying panels or some big system upfront. It's a savings program where you lock in a lower power rate. Instead of renting power from the utility forever, you're just **getting cheaper power locked in**.  
What bill range are you typically seeing in the summer?
[followup]
Got it — with numbers like that, this could be a pretty serious cut in cost for you.

[objection]
solar is a scam
[response]
You’re right to be skeptical — there are a lot of companies doing it the wrong way. What we’re part of is a **state-backed relief program** that only works if it actually saves you money. There's no sales pitch or pressure — just a technician who explains what it would look like, and if it doesn’t save you money, you walk away.  
Fair enough?
[followup]
Totally — no pressure either way, but good to at least see if you qualify, right?

[objection]
money upfront
[response]
Totally fair — if there was a big cost upfront, I’d feel the same way. This program is **$0 down** — no install fees, no setup costs. You’re simply switching power providers and locking in a better rate.  
You’re still getting a full system, it’s just funded differently.  
Do you own the home?
[followup]
Perfect — that’s exactly the kind of property this applies to.

[objection]
hate the way they look
[response]
Yeah I get that — aesthetics matter. A lot of newer installs are actually **black-on-black low-profile panels** that blend in way better. Some even go on the back side of the roof if you prefer. But let’s be real — if it cut your bill by 30–40%, would the look still be a dealbreaker?
[followup]
Exactly — and honestly, most people say they barely even notice them after install.

[objection]
why do you need my credit?
[response]
Good question. This is a **relief program**, and to qualify they just want to make sure you're a responsible homeowner — so they ask if your score is at least **650 or better**. No social, no pull, nothing sensitive — it's just a qualification filter.  
Would you say you’re above that?
[followup]
Awesome — that should definitely qualify you for the better rate tiers.

[objection]
i’m in oil and gas
[response]
Hey, that’s fair — and to be honest, most of the people going solar aren't doing it to be green. They're doing it to **beat the utility hikes**. It's not political — it’s just smart long-term math.  
What do your summer bills usually look like out there?
[followup]
Whew yeah, you’re definitely overpaying. Let’s change that.

[objection]
technology isn't there yet
[response]
Totally hear you — but just so you know, the **tech hasn't really changed much in the last 10 years**. These systems are already warrantied for 25 years and produce reliably year after year. This isn’t beta tech — it's proven and built to last.  
Is your roof in good shape right now?
[followup]
Perfect — that’s all we’d really need to check to get you qualified.

[objection]
i don’t want to finance
[response]
Gotcha — and good news, this isn’t financing in the traditional sense. You’re **not buying panels** — you're simply locking in a lower rate for the power you’re already buying. No new loan, just cheaper electricity.  
What kind of bill range do you usually see?
[followup]
Wow — okay yeah, that’s a good chunk of change you’re already spending.

[objection]
i don’t want a loan
[response]
I get that — and that’s the beauty of this program. No loan, no debt added to your name. It’s more like switching from Verizon to T-Mobile — you’re just changing who provides your power, and locking in a better deal.  
What would you say your average bill looks like?
[followup]
That’s perfect — you’re exactly the type of household they’re targeting.

[objection]
don’t want to pay it for 25 years
[response]
Fair concern — but you’re **already going to be paying for power for the next 25 years**, whether you go solar or not. The question is just: Do you want to keep renting it at a rising rate — or lock in a discount?  
Have you seen your rate go up recently?
[followup]
Right? It’s been climbing nonstop — this kind of locks it in before it gets worse.

[objection]
this isn’t my forever home
[response]
Totally get that — and honestly, solar actually **makes homes sell faster and for more**. The new buyer just inherits the lower bill, so you don’t lose a penny. It’s not like a remodel — it’s just passing along savings.  
How long are you planning to stay?
[followup]
Nice — that gives us plenty of time to show the benefit and get you some savings.

[objection]
what is this for?
[response]
Great question — it’s actually super simple. We’re just setting up a quick **consultation with a technician** to check if your home qualifies for this relief program. Takes 10–15 minutes and just shows how much you’d save.  
What’s your schedule like this week?
[followup]
Cool — I’ll make sure they reach out to confirm what works best for you.

[objection]
how does it work?
[response]
Love the curiosity — here’s the gist: a technician comes by, checks if your home qualifies, shows you the savings estimate, and answers all your questions. If it makes sense, great. If not, no pressure.  
Do you usually have high summer bills?
[followup]
Oof yeah — we’ve been seeing that a lot lately. Glad we caught you now.

[objection]
i’m out of town
[response]
No worries — we’re just scheduling the **next available window**. I’ll note that you’re out of town now, but we’ll get you set for when you’re back.  
What day are you flying back in?
[followup]
Perfect — we’ll set it up right after you’re back.

[objection]
i can’t this week
[response]
Totally understandable — we’re booking out next week too. Let me see what’s still open… are you better earlier in the week or later?
[followup]
Alright — I’ll pencil you in for that part of the week.

[objection]
i can’t today
[response]
All good — we’ve got availability later this week and into next. Are mornings or evenings easier for you?
[followup]
Got it — we’ll lean toward that time when setting you up.

[objection]
i can’t tonight
[response]
No problem — we’ve got slots tomorrow and the rest of the week too. Are you more of a morning or afternoon type?
[followup]
Sounds good — I’ll mark you down for that slot.

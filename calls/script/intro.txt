Hey, uh… Sam?

Hey Sam, this is Rachel — you should’ve gotten a notice recently on your utility bill from CenterPoint, probably about 2–3 months ago.  
It was that little yellow strip at the bottom — had to do with the rate hikes and those rolling outages.  
Did you happen to catch that?  
[gather]

No worries — that’s actually why we’re calling. It looked like you never received it on our end.  

So, quick heads-up — this is just part of a grid relief push here in Texas.  
The state’s basically trying to reduce how much load is on the grid…  
and so they’ve been quietly incentivizing certain utility zones like CenterPoint to get people on more efficient power plans.
This is still your property at [123 Main St], right?  
[gather]

Okay I'll notate that and by the way the switch isn't required but can end up saving folks 30 to 40% annually — which is like a thousand bucks a year or more, depending on usage.  
Just out of curiosity though, was your last bill well over $150?  
[gather]

Okay, yeah, that makes sense. You’re exactly the type of home they look for with usage that high.

Before I waste your time — let me just make sure your property even qualifies…

You own it — not renting or anything?  
[gather]

Cool. And as long as your credit score’s somewhere around a 650 or better — not perfect, just solid — you’d usually qualify for these new plans.  
You think you're in that ballpark?  
[gather]

Perfect. And I assume there haven’t been any recent bankruptcies or foreclosures in the last couple years?  
[gather]

Okay, great. So before I explain the program — real quick, are you familiar with the big solar scam going on in your area?  
[gather]

Yeah, so there’s a ton of door knockers and ads right now trying to get people to buy, finance, or lease panels — locking folks into big loans or 25-year liens on the house.  
Have you had any of those people hit your door lately?  
[gather]

Yeah — exactly. So what we’re doing is actually the opposite of that.  
There’s a new power purchase agreement — kind of like what you’re already on with Reliant or whoever you’ve got —  
except now you’re purchasing that power directly from your own roof, not the grid.

They install the panels for free, maintain them, insure them — and instead of paying a big utility bill each month,  
you just pay for the power you produce at a drastically lower rate.

But it’s usually a lot cheaper — again, its anywhere from five hundred dollars to a thousand or more per year less than what you currently spend is pretty common.

Now, we don’t send out a salesperson or anything — it’s just one of our local technicians who stops by,  
does a super quick inspection, and gives you the actual savings report.  
Nothing you sign up for on the spot or anything like that — just shows you what you’d qualify for. Fair enough?
[gather]

Cool — looks like I’ve got everything I need here.  
What I’ll do is pass this to one of our head techs — he’ll probably give you a ring here in the next ten to fifteen minutes,  
to see if he’s got anyone in your area this week that can pop by and drop off the report.

So just keep an eye out for that call — it should come from a 281 or 832 number.  
Sound good?  
[gather]

Is there any reason he wouldnt reach you here in ten?
[gather]

Alright, awesome — i'm gonna shoot him an email now and he will get with you in a few. Have a blessed day.
